# Database for user data storage

User information needs to be stored such as transactions, account deposits, etc. Additionally, the database will be used to store calculated performance metrics.

## Database Sepcifications:

The database tested will be hosted on a local NAS using Docker (with ports revealed).

A user will need to be created who will own / access the database.

- Version: Postgres 14.2
- Name: performant
- Owner: kxz167
- Database local port (meaningless for you): 15432

## Database Access and folder uploads:

All database updating and SQL commands are done using another Docker instance of pgAdmin4. The UI is just intuitive and easy to use so I prefer it much more to the CLI.

## File Directory:

- create_db.sql
    - The DATABASE creation command as generated by pgAdmin4
